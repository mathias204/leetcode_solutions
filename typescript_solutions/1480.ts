 * Return the running sum of nums.

 * Note: this is my description of what the solution holds.
 * Now that I see this code it shows that my code is bad in many ways. I calculate the sum again from zero for every item in the array while you can just add the number to the sum as you go.
 * The map function also make so the code does not used for loops which looks much better.
